        I'm a seasoned full-stack developer with a treasure chest of
        experienceâ€”15+ years with .NET and over the past few years im making
        (Azure, AWS & GCP) my second home. Here, you'll find a few of
        projects that not only showcase my technical wizardry but also my
        journey from mere mortals' codes to the cloud nine of software
        development. ðŸš€ <br />
        Strap in and enjoy the ride through my world of code, creativity, and
        cloud mastery!
