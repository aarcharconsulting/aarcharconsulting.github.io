          Oh, and for those wondering why React, TypeScript, and Tailwind?
          Because sometimes, in the vast sea of technology, you just have to
          pick your boat and sail with style. Consider this my stylish voyage
          across the digital oceans. Plus, who doesn't love a bit of
          component-based architecture and utility-first CSS with a type-safe
          journey? 😉🚀
